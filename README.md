# Heat-flux-with-Machine-Learning
Conducted advanced data analysis to predict missing equilibrium quality, improving heat exchanger efficiency and safety
A data analysis project focused on predicting missing equilibrium quality values (x_e_out [-]) within a critical heat flux (CHF) dataset. This dataset covered diverse two-phase flow boiling systems, ranging from high-power microprocessor cooling to nuclear power plants. Employing advanced linear regression techniques and leveraging a range of critical parameters such as geometry, pressure, mass flux, equivalent diameter, heated diameter, and heated length, this project aimed to provide insights into CHF behavior. Ultimately, the project contributed to the optimization of heat exchanger design and the implementation of safety measures for more efficient heat transfer, demonstrating a strong command of data-driven decision-making and problem-solving
